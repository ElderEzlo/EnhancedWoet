A LUA script for the Just Cause 2 Multiplayer Mod

by: ElderEzlo

based on the script written by JC2MP Dev Woet, which can be found here:

===============
I. Introduction
===============

I had two main reasons for writing this script.
First, the newer barrel-roll style Woet script is fun, but I always preferred the original version, which launches your vehicle straight into the air. My version of this script offers both of these options, as well as a spin and a flip because hey why not?
Second, I think the chat command activation method was slow, and also requires the often spam-filled chat box to be visible. Instead, I decided it would more user-friendly to use simply key presses for activation.

II. USAGE
=========

By default, the various actions use the following key bindings:
Jump: J
Roll: K
Spin: L
Flip: ;
These can be edited at the top of the client\EnhancedWoet.lua file. Immediately after the keybindings, you can disable any of the manoeuvers if you want.
